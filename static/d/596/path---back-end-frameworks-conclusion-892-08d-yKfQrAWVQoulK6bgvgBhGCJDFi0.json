{"data":{"conclusion":{"html":"<p> JavaScript on the server is in a weird state. While countless frameworks emerge every year, very few manage to gain enough momentum to challenge <strong>Express</strong>. Even <strong>Koa</strong>, sometimes billed as Express' successor, has a lower satisfaction ratio (and vastly lower usage numbers).</p>\n<p>One interesting entrant in the space is <strong>Next.js</strong>, which has been generating a lot of interest lately. Although it's not quite comparable to a full-featured Node back-end, its single-minded focus on solving the server-side-rendering problem for React apps has made it a very useful tool. </p>\n<p>It's also interesting to see what role serverless technologies like <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/\">AWS Lambda</a> will play over the next couple of years. Who knows, the back-end category as we know it might soon be a thing of the past!</p>"},"opinions":{"opinions":[{"survey_id":"2016","tools":[{"tool_id":"meteor","counts":{"would_use":1117,"would_not_use":752,"interested":2822,"not_interested":4406,"never_heard":1153}},{"tool_id":"feathers","counts":{"would_use":93,"would_not_use":60,"interested":666,"not_interested":1243,"never_heard":8188}}]},{"survey_id":"2017","tools":[{"tool_id":"meteor","counts":{"would_use":1625,"would_not_use":1959,"interested":5395,"not_interested":11202,"never_heard":3485}},{"tool_id":"express","counts":{"would_use":14514,"would_not_use":1183,"interested":3795,"not_interested":2271,"never_heard":1903}},{"tool_id":"koa","counts":{"would_use":2194,"would_not_use":439,"interested":4207,"not_interested":4243,"never_heard":12583}},{"tool_id":"sails","counts":{"would_use":630,"would_not_use":1097,"interested":2429,"not_interested":6262,"never_heard":13248}},{"tool_id":"feathers","counts":{"would_use":446,"would_not_use":178,"interested":1665,"not_interested":2819,"never_heard":18558}}]},{"survey_id":"2018","tools":[{"tool_id":"meteor","counts":{"would_use":922,"would_not_use":1533,"interested":3587,"not_interested":9727,"never_heard":3939}},{"tool_id":"express","counts":{"would_use":12764,"would_not_use":768,"interested":3216,"not_interested":1737,"never_heard":1233}},{"tool_id":"nextjs","counts":{"would_use":1701,"would_not_use":226,"interested":6902,"not_interested":3621,"never_heard":7236}},{"tool_id":"koa","counts":{"would_use":1491,"would_not_use":268,"interested":3467,"not_interested":4600,"never_heard":9872}},{"tool_id":"sails","counts":{"would_use":335,"would_not_use":858,"interested":1838,"not_interested":6038,"never_heard":10620}},{"tool_id":"feathers","counts":{"would_use":317,"would_not_use":145,"interested":1177,"not_interested":3213,"never_heard":14839}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"conclusion","type":"conclusion","section":"back-end-frameworks","previous":{"id":"other-libraries","type":"other-libraries","section":"back-end-frameworks","basePath":"/back-end-frameworks/other-libraries/"},"next":{"id":"testing","type":"section","basePath":"/testing/overview/"},"basePath":"/back-end-frameworks/conclusion/","locale":"en-US","localeLabel":"English","localePath":""}}
